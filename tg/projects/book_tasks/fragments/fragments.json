And I should like to sleep with Rosey\u2019s arms around me,Pate thought. He shifted restlessly on the bench. By the morrow the girl could well be his.I will take her far from Oldtown, across the narrow sea to one of the Free Cities.There were no maesters there, no one to accuse him.He could hear Emma\u2019s laughter coming through a shuttered window overhead, mingled with the deeper voice of the man she was entertaining. She was the oldest of the serving wenches at the Quill and Tankard, forty if she was a day, but still pretty in a fleshy sort of way. Rosey was her daughter, fifteen and freshly flowered. Emma had decreed that Rosey\u2019s maidenhead would cost a golden dragon. Pate had saved nine silver stags and a pot of copper stars and pennies, for all the good that would do him. He would have stood a better chance of hatching a real dragon than saving up enough coin to make a golden one.Armen wore a leather thong about his neck, strung with links of pewter, tin, lead, and copper, and like most acolytes he seemed to believe that novices had turnips growing from their shoulders in place of heads. He was a comely youth, their Sphinx. All the serving wenches doted on him. Even Rosey would sometimes touch him on the arm when she brought him wine, and Pate had to gnash his teeth and pretend not to see.Dragging his clubfoot, Mollander took a short hop, whirled, and whipped the apple sidearm into the mists that hung above the Honeywine. If not for his foot, he would have been a knight like his father. He had the strength for it in those thick arms and broad shoulders. Far and fast the apple flew\u2026\u2026 but not as fast as the arrow that whistled after it, a yard-long shaft of golden wood fletched with scarlet feathers. Pate did not see the arrow catch the apple, but he heard it. A softchunkechoed back across the river, followed by a splash.Mollander whistled. Sweet.\u201d",

Sometimes she went barefoot as she served, to feel the grass beneath her feet. He loved that too. He loved the clean fresh smell of her, the way her hair curled behind her ears. He even loved her toes. One night she\u2019d let him rub her feet and play with them, and he\u2019d made up a funny tale for every toe to keep her giggling.Perhaps he would do better to remain on this side of the narrow sea. He could buy a donkey with the coin he\u2019d saved, and he and Rosey could take turns riding it as they wandered Westeros. Ebrose might not think him worthy of the silver, but Pate knew how to set a bone and leech a fever. The smallfolk would be grateful for his help. If he could learn to cut hair and shave beards, he might even be a barber.That would be enough,he told himself,so long as I had Rosey.Rosey was all that he wanted in the world.That had not always been so. Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to some open-handed lord who would honor him for his wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on him to thank him for his service. How high he\u2019d ride, how nobly, smiling down at the smallfolk when he passed them on the road\u2026One night in the Quill and Tankard\u2019s common room, after his second tankard of fearsomely strong cider, Pate had boasted that he would not always be a novice. He drained the dregs of his tankard. The torchlit terrace of the Quill and Tankard was an island of light in a sea of mist this morning. Downriver, the distant beacon of the Hightower floated in the damp of night like a hazy orange moon, but the light did little to lift his spirits.",

It would not have been the first time that good fortune had turned sour on Pate. He had once counted himself lucky to be chosen to help old Archmaester Walgrave with the ravens, never dreaming that before long he would also be fetching the man\u2019s meals, sweeping out his chambers, and dressing him every morning. Everyone said that Walgrave had forgotten more of ravencraft than most maesters ever knew, so Pate assumed a black iron link was the least that he could hope for, only to find that Walgrave could not grant him one. The old man remained an archmaester only by courtesy. As great a maester as once he\u2019d been, now his robes concealed soiled smallclothes oft as not, and half a year ago some acolytes found him weeping in the Library, unable to find his way back to his chambers. Maester Gormon sat below the iron mask in Walgrave\u2019s place, the same Gormon who had once accused Pate of theft.In the apple tree beside the water, a nightingale began to sing. It was a sweet sound, a welcome respite from the harsh screams and endlessquorking of the ravens he had tended all day long. The big white birds were Archmaester Walgrave\u2019s pride. He wanted them to eat him when he died, but Pate half suspected that they meant to eat him too.",

I can change iron into gold.\u201d And then the coin was in his hand, dancing across his knuckles, the soft yellow gold shining in the candlelight. On one side was a three-headed dragon, on the other the head of some dead king.Gold for iron,Pate remembered,you won\u2019t do better. Do you want her? Three days had passed. Pate had returned to the Quill and Tankard, still uncertain what he was, but instead of the alchemist he\u2019d found Mollander and Armen and the Sphinx, with Roone in tow. It would have raised suspicions not to join them.The Quill and Tankard never closed. For six hundred years it had been standing on its island in the Honeywine, and never once had its doors been shut to trade. Though the tall, timbered building leaned toward the south the way novices sometimes leaned after a tankard, Pate expected that the inn would go on standing for another six hundred years, selling wine and ale and fearsomely strong cider to rivermen and seamen, smiths and singers, priests and princes, and the novices and acolytes of the Citadel.He was a knight\u2019s son, and drunk as drunk could be. Since they brought him word of his father\u2019s death upon the Blackwater, he got drunk most every night. Even in Oldtown, far from the fighting and safe behind its walls, the War of the Five Kings had touched them all\u2026 although Archmaester Benedict insisted that there had never been a war of five kings, since Renly Baratheon had been slain before Balon Greyjoy had crowned himself.These sailors\u2019 stories\u2026\u201dGo back down to the docks, and I wager you\u2019ll find sailors who\u2019ll tell you of the mermaids that they bedded, or how they spent a year in the belly of a fish.\u201d",

One sailor with a story, aye, a man might laugh at that, but when oarsmen off four different ships tell the same tale in four different tongues\u2026\u201dMollander grew more stubborn when he drank, and even when sober he was bullheaded. The only dragon Pate cared about was made of yellow gold. He wondered what had happened to the alchemist.The third day. He said he\u2019d be here.Mollander scooped up the windfall. The arrow caught the apple as it began to fall and sliced it clean in two. One half landed on a turret roof, tumbled to a lower roof, bounced, and missed Armen by a foot. The Sphinx was always smiling, as if he knew some secret jape. It gave him a wicked look that went well with his pointed chin, widow\u2019s peak, and dense mat of close-cropped jet-black curls.Alleras would make a maester. He had only been at the Citadel for a year, yet already he had forged three links of his maester\u2019s chain. Armen might have more, but each of his had taken him a year to earn. Still, he would make a maester too. Roone and Mollander remained pink-necked novices, but Roone was very young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading.Pate, though\u2026He had been five years at the Citadel, arriving when he was no more than three-and-ten, yet his neck remained as pink as it had been on the day he first arrived from the westerlands. Twice had he believed himself ready. The first time he had gone before Archmaester Vaellyn to demonstrate his knowledge of the heavens. Instead he learned how Vinegar Vaellyn had earned that name. It took Pate two years to summon up the courage to try again. This time he submitted himself to kindly old Archmaester Ebrose, renowned for his soft voice and gentle hands, but Ebrose\u2019s sighs had somehow proved just as painful as Vaellyn\u2019s barbs.He spied an apple on a branch, jumped up, pulled it down, and threw. Alleras drew his bowstring back to his ear, turning gracefully to follow the target in flight. He loosed his shaft just as the apple began to fall.The apple splashed down into the river, untouched.",

Pate had tried to bend it once, and failed.The Sphinx looks slight, but there\u2019s strength in those slim arms,he reflected, as Alleras threw a leg across the bench and reached for his wine cup. Roone wanted to know. Alleras sipped his wine. The rest of them were quaffing tankards of the fearsomely strong cider that the Quill and Tankard was renowned for, but he preferred the strange, sweet wines of his mother\u2019s country. Even in Oldtown such wines did not come cheap.A sphinx is a bit of this, a bit of that: a human face, the body of a lion, the wings of a hawk. Alleras was the same: his father was a Dornishman, his mother a black-skinned Summer Islander. His own skin was dark as teak. And like the green marble sphinxes that flanked the Citadel\u2019s main gate, Alleras had eyes of onyx.Furthermore, the Targaryens are all dead.\u201dWe speak of Rhaegar\u2019s sister, born on Dragonstone before its fall.

Lazy Leo was slouching by the foot of the old plank bridge, draped in satin striped in green and gold, with a black silk half cape pinned to his shoulder by a rose of jade.

It is made in the shape of a candle to remind us that a maester must cast light wherever he serves, and it is sharp to remind us that knowledge can be dangerous. Wise men may grow arrogant in their wisdom, but a maester must always remain humble. The glass candle reminds us of that as well. Even after he has said his vow and donned his chain and gone forth to serve, a maester will think back on the darkness of his vigil and remember how nothing that he did could make the candle burn\u2026 for even with knowledge, some things are not possible.\u201dLazy Leo burst out laughing. I saw the candle burning with my own eyes.\u201dThe light was queer and bright, much brighter than any beeswax or tallow candle. It cast strange shadows and the flame never flickered, not even when a draft blew through the open door behind me.\u201dArmen crossed his arms. Somehow that seemed important.Old powers waken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heroes.\u201d He stretched, smiling his lazy smile. Those who mean to forge a silver link would do well not to miss his talk.\u201dMollander pushed back from the table. The Sphinx reached for his bowcase.

Mollander was so drunk he had to walk with a hand on Roone\u2019s shoulder to keep from falling. The Citadel was no great distance as the raven flies, but none of them were ravens and Oldtown was a veritable labyrinth of a city, all wynds and crisscrossing alleys and narrow crookback streets.

Leo grinned. One day I suppose I must find out.\u201dPate knew better than to reply to that.Leo needed no reply. You ought to thank me.\u201dI ought to kill you,Pate thought, but he was not near drunk enough to throw away his life. Leo had been trained to arms, and was known to be deadly with bravo\u2019s blade and dagger. And if Pate should somehow kill him, it would mean his own head too. Leo had two names where Pate had only one, and his second wasTyrell.Ser Moryn Tyrell, commander of the City Watch of Oldtown, was Leo\u2019s father. Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South, was Leo\u2019s cousin. The mists were lightening to the east.Dawn,Pate realized.Dawn has come, and the alchemist has not.He did not know whether he should laugh or cry.Am I still a thief if I put it all back and no one ever knows?It was another question that he had no answer for, like those that Ebrose and Vaellyn had once asked him.When he pushed back from the bench and got to his feet, the fearsomely strong cider all went to his head at once.

By the time he reached the other side, the eastern sky was turning pink.The world is wide,he told himself.If I bought that donkey, I could still wander the roads and byways of the Seven Kingdoms, leeching the smallfolk and picking nits out of their hair. I could sign on to some ship, pull an oar, and sail to Qarth by the Jade Gates to see these bloody dragons for myself. I do not need to go back to old Walgrave and the ravens.Yet somehow his feet turned back toward the Citadel.When the first shaft of sunlight broke through the clouds to the east, morning bells began to peal from the Sailor\u2019s Sept down by the harbor. The Lord\u2019s Sept joined in a moment later, then the Seven Shrines from their gardens across the Honeywine, and finally the Starry Sept that had been the seat of the High Septon for a thousand years before Aegon landed at King\u2019s Landing. They made a mighty music.Though not so sweet as one small nightingale.He could hear singing too, beneath the pealing of the bells. Each morning at first light the red priests gathered to welcome the sun outside their modest wharfside temple.For the night is dark and full of terrors.Pate had heard them cry those words a hundred times, asking their god R\u2019hllor to save them from the darkness. The Seven were gods enough for him, but he had heard that Stannis Baratheon worshiped at the nightfires now. He had even put the fiery heart of R\u2019hllor on his banners in place of the crowned stag.If he should win the Iron Throne, we\u2019ll all need to learn the words of the red priests\u2019 song,Pate thought, but that was not likely. Tywin Lannister had smashed Stannis and R\u2019hllor upon the Blackwater, and soon enough he would finish them and mount the head of the Baratheon pretender on a spike above the gates of King\u2019s Landing.",

Pate had never seen King\u2019s Landing, but he knew it was a daub-and-wattle city, a sprawl of mud streets, thatched roofs, and wooden hovels. Oldtown was built in stone, and all its streets were cobbled, down to the meanest alley. The city was never more beautiful than at break of day. West of the Honeywine, the Guildhalls lined the bank like a row of palaces. Upriver, the domes and towers of the Citadel rose on both sides of the river, connected by stone bridges crowded with halls and houses. Downstream, below the black marble walls and arched windows of the Starry Sept, the manses of the pious clustered like children gathered round the feet of an old dowager.And beyond, where the Honeywine widened into Whispering Sound, rose the Hightower, its beacon fires bright against the dawn. From where it stood atop the bluffs of Battle Island, its shadow cut the city like a sword. Those born and raised in Oldtown could tell the time of day by where that shadow fell. Some claimed a man could see all the way to the Wall from the top. Perhaps that was why Lord Leyton had not made the descent in more than a decade, preferring to rule his city from the clouds.A butcher\u2019s cart rumbled past Pate down the river road, five piglets in the back squealing in distress. Dodging from its path, he just avoided being spattered as a townswoman emptied a pail of night soil from a window overhead.When I am a maester in a castle I will have a horse to ride,he thought. Then he tripped upon a cobble and wondered who he was fooling. There would be no chain for him, no seat at a lord\u2019s high table, no tall white horse to ride. His days would be spent listening to ravensquorkand scrubbing shit stains off Archmaester Walgrave\u2019s smallclothes.The alchemist was standing over him.Pate rose. It was not my wish to intrude upon your fellowship.\u201d The alchemist wore a hooded traveler\u2019s cloak, brown and nondescript.

Though the box was stoutly made and bound with iron, its lock was broken. Maester Gormon had suspected Pate of breaking it, but that wasn\u2019t true. Walgrave had broken the lock himself, after losing the key that opened it.Inside, Pate had found a bag of silver stags, a lock of yellow hair tied up in a ribbon, a painted miniature of a woman who resembled Walgrave , and a knight\u2019s gauntlet made of lobstered steel. The gauntlet had belonged to a prince, Walgrave claimed, though he could no longer seem to recall which one. When Pate shook it, the key fell out onto the floor.If I pick that up, I am a thief,he remembered thinking. The key was old and heavy, made of black iron; supposedly it opened every door at the Citadel. Only the archmaesters had such keys. The others carried theirs upon their person or hid them away in some safe place, but if Walgrave had hidden his, no one would ever have seen it again. Pate snatched up the key and had been halfway to the door before turning back to take the silver too. I want to see.\u201d Pate did not intend to let himself be cheated.Come.\u201dHe had no time to think about it, to weigh his choices. The alchemist was walking away. Pate had to follow or lose Rosey and the dragon both, forever. He followed. As they walked, he slipped his hand up into his sleeve. He could feel the key, safe inside the hidden pocket he had sewn there. Maester\u2019s robes were full of pockets. He had known that since he was a boy.He had to hurry to keep pace with the alchemist\u2019s longer strides. They went down an alley, around a corner, through the old Thieves Market, along Ragpicker\u2019s Wynd. Finally, the man turned into another alley, narrower than the first. We\u2019ll do it here.\u201dThe coin appeared. The alchemist made it walk across his knuckles, the way he had when Rosey brought the two of them together.
