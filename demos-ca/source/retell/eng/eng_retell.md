## Chapter 1:

It is early July in St. Petersburg, and very hot. A good-looking young man who is nearly destitute and greatly in debt to his landlady manages to slip out of the house unnoticed. He is relieved, not because he is a coward by nature but because he has been irritable and tense for some time and dreads meeting anyone at all, let alone his landlady.

The young man thinks to himself in a rapidly rambling fashion about some unknown deed which he seems torn about committing. On the one hand, he wants to do it, but on the other he tries to convince himself that he is merely toying with the idea and isn't serious about pursuing it into action.

The youth is revolted by the heat and stench of his surroundings, but loses himself in his thoughts, which sometimes become muddled as he has not eaten much in two days. He is roused from his reverie by a drunk shouting an insult about his hat. Suddenly afraid, he clutches his hat, and mutters feverishly to himself that the hat is too conspicuous and can be "noticed . . . and remembered" as evidence.

He approaches a house, where he is to "make a trial of his undertaking" (i.e. the unknown deed preying on his mind). He climbs up the back stairs to the fourth floor, noting that one of the tenants on that floor is moving out, so that "for a while only the old woman's apartment will be left occupied. That's good . . . just in case . . .," he thinks before ringing the bell.

The door is answered by a suspicious sixty-year-old woman, who mistrustfully lets him in.

The young man introduces himself as "Raskolnikov, a student," who had been to her a month ago. The woman remembers him, and lets him come into another room. With his characteristic hyper-awareness, Raskolnikov notes every detail of the spotless room and its furniture.

It turns out that this old lady, Alyona Ivanovna, is a pawnbroker, and Raskolnikov had gone to her a month ago with a ring of his father's. His pledge has expired, but he begs her to be patient and presents her with an old watch. He asks four roubles; she offers one and a half with interest paid in advance. Raskolnikov is angered, but he has no other way, and recalling his original purpose of a "trial," he reluctantly accepts her offer.

He watches Alyona Ivanovna get out her keys and go into another room. As he waits, he listens and figures out what she is doingopening the top drawer, with which key, etc. She returns with his money, having deducted the interest from not only the current pledge but the previous one as well, so he gets only one rouble 15 kopecks.

Raskolnikov doesn't argue, and takes the money, then mumbles something about bringing her a nice silver cigarette case later. As he walks out, he asks casually whether she stays at home alone, without her sister, but is answered with a suspicious question only. He leaves as quickly as he can, feeling disturbed, and his agitation increases until, in the middle of the street, he bursts out incredulously about his contemplation of "such horror," which has been dogging his thoughts for a month.

This outburst does nothing to relieve him, however, and weaves down the street unevenly until he returns to his senses near a tavern. He immediately enters, suddenly realizing how faint he is from hunger and thirst.

Once he drinks a cold beer, he feels relieved, and starts to think more rationally, trying to tell himself that he only needed some nourishment and that there is really nothing to worry about. However, he does sense a dim foreboding that his cheerfulness is just as morbid as his previous state.

There are not many people in the tavern: a tradesman, his friendwho has dozed off and awakens every so often to sing some maudlin tuneand someone who looks like a retired official and appears agitated.

## Chapter 2:

Although he has been avoiding people for the past month, Raskolnikov feels suddenly drawn to be with them, and actually enjoys sitting in the tavern despite its dirty dinginess. He feels a keen interest in the retired official, who apparently feels a similar interest, since he keeps looking at Raskolnikov with the evident desire to strike up a conversation. He is ragged in appearance, and seems agitated.

Finally he addresses Raskolnikov directly, introducing himself as Marmeladov, a titular councillor. He asks Raskolnikov whether he is in the civil service as well; the young man, surprised at the direct address and at Marmeladov's strangely ornate speech, replies that he is a student. Delighted, and clearly drunk, Marmeladov sits himself with Raskolnikov and starts to talk about his life.

He is a self-proclaimed drunk, berating himself while yet not changing his ways; a certain Mr. Lebezyatnikov had beaten Marmeladov's wife a month ago and he had done nothing about it; his daughter has prostituted herself to provide money for the family, because of his incompetence. Those in the tavern listen mockingly, laughing at him; but he only increases his dignity as they do so.

As he babbles on, a picture of his miserable existence begins to emerge. His wife, Katerina Ivanovna, drags him about by the hair (of which he seems almost proud) and is ill while having to care for their three small children. A widow, she had consented to marry him "weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands," and he had not touched alcohol for an entire year; but upon losing his job he turned to the bottle. Since then the family had moved around and Marmeladov had obtained a position and lost it through drinking. Sonya, his daughter from a previous marriage, had had minimal education (though she appears intelligent); unfortunately she had not been able to earn much money through her handiwork. Finally Katerina Ivanovna, upset and ill, had bullied Sonya into prostituting herself. Shortly thereafter, Sonya was no longer allowed to live in the apartment with her family, and had to rent a room from a tailor named Kapernaumov.

Marmeladov had then gone to beg a job from one Ivan Afanasyevich (apparently a higher official), and had obtained one. The family rejoiced and prepared him with a uniform and good food; and he had brought home his salary of 23 roubles 40 kopecks six days ago, causing his wife much joy. Marmeladov himself had indulged in sweet dreams of success and happiness. But the very next evening, he had stolen the money and spent it all on drink, thereby losing everything. He had run away from home, but had even gone back to Sonya to ask her for money for drink.

Amidst laughter and derision, Marmeladov declares he deserves no pity, but that all along he has only sought sorrow, not joy. He then goes off on a long impassioned speech about how the Lord will forgive his whole family on Judgement Day. The words temporarily impress his hearers, but they are soon laughing and mocking him again.

Marmeladov asks Raskolnikov to take him back home to his wife. Raskolnikov does so, leading him into his miserably poor room, where Katerina Ivanovna paces almost deliriously, wasted from consumption as well as worry.

When she sees Marmeladov, she drags him inside by his hair, wailing loudly and berating him for drinking up all the money while his children go hungry. She kicks Raskolnikov out, assuming him to be a drinking partner of her husband's; he is only too glad to hasten out, as neighbors are starting to peek in and laugh at the scene. Amalia Lippewechsel, the landlady, barges in at last and shouts at the Marmeladovs to clear out by the next day.

As he leaves, Raskolnikov digs up all the change he has and lays it unobserved on the windowsill. Within minutes, he is questioning his own act and wants to get it back, but he knows he can't and wouldn't take it anyway. He reflects on how the family is using Sonya for money.

## Chapter 3:

Raskolnikov awakens the next day feeling unrested, and angrily looks around his tiny, shabby room.

Nastasya, the landlady's cook and only servant, wakes him up by shouting at him. Though her conversation is slighting, she is kind enough to bring him some of her own tea and offer him leftovers from the previous day's meal (his landlady has stopped sending up his dinners because he is behind in his rent). As Raskolnikov eats, Nastasya prattles on about how his landlady is going to report him to the police for not paying his rent but refusing to vacate, and upbraids him for not doing anything. He replies that he does work. She asks what kind of work, and he replies that he thinks, which response sends her into gales of laughter.

After some further uncomfortable exchange, she remembers that she has a letter for him, and gives it to him. Seeing that it is from his mother, he orders Nastasya to leave, and after lingering adoringly on it, he opens it up.

Clearly, his mother has been having troubles and has been unable to send her son any money, though she wished to in order to help him continue his studies. Now, however, she feels she has good news, and proceeds to tell the following story:

Dunya, Raskolnikov's sister, had been working as a governess in the home of the Svidrigailovs, where she suffered a fair amount of rudeness and discourtesy from Mr. Svidrigailov. As it turned out, he had been attracted to her, and at last he propositioned her. Naturally, Dunya refused, but Svidrigailov persisted in pursuing her.

Unfortunately for Dunya, Marfa Petrovna, the lady of the house, overheard her husband and Dunya in the garden one day, and confronted them with the assumption that Dunya was at fault. Marfa Petrovna slapped Dunya and kicked her out, sending her back home in an open peasant cart in the rain. She then proceeded to stain Dunya's reputation all over town, making life very difficult for the girl and her mother.

At last, Svidrigailov stepped in and showed his wife a letter Dunya had written to him while she had been at their house, reproaching him for his behavior and refusing to meet with him. This, in addition to the word of the servants in the Svidrigailov household, served to vindicate Dunya.

Marfa Petrovna, shamed and convinced, then proceeded to right the wrongs she had inflicted, going to remarkable and perhaps unnecessary lengths to restore Dunya's reputation (notably by copying the letter Dunya had written and going from house to house reading it for several days). Dunya was given job offers and the whole town began treating her with respect, and one Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a distant relative of Marfa Petrovna, proposed to her. After a sleepless night of pacing and prayer, Dunya accepted him.

This gentleman, 45 years old, well-off and respectable, does not love Dunya, as is clear, but the marriage will be one of convenience to both parties. He currently is on his way to Petersburg, and the hope is expressed that he might be able to get Raskolnikov a job. Dunya has been making future plans on the expectation that her influence will help her family to better themselves, although apparently Luzhin has not asked her mother to stay with them.

Finally his mother writes that she and Dunya will be going to Petersburg very soon, and are excited about seeing Raskolnikov, though the trip will cost them as Luzhin is not paying for the trip but only for the transport of their luggage.

Raskolnikov lays his head down and thinks for a long while, but starts to feel confined and jumps up and goes out. He heads for Vasilievsky Island, talking to himself so that he appears drunk to passersby.

## Chapter 4:

Raskolnikov has been disturbed by his mother's letter, but he knows one thing: that the marriage of his sister with Mr. Luzhin will not take place as long as he lives!

He can see right through his mother's optimistic writing and his sister's acts. Luzhin is clearly a miser, arrogant, condescending to his future wife's family; and Dunya is clearly everything good, strong and noble. Obviously she is marrying him ("selling herself," as Raskolnikov puts it) for the sake of her brother and mother. Raskolnikov even knows that it is he, above their mother, for whom such a sacrifice is being made. He equates Dunya's sacrifice with Sonya's. Passionately, he rejects the sacrifice.

Suddenly, however, he pulls himself up short. How, he asks himself, is he going to stop it? What can he do? He has no way of finishing his studies to find a position to make money and prevent the necessity of such a marriage. Money is needed immediately.

Raskolnikov has tortured himself with these questions before, and now even takes a sick delight in them. But the letter suddenly blinds him with the realization that "at least something" must be done now. And that "something" is the unnamed deed which has been tormenting him for the past month.

He searches for a bench, feeling like he needs to sit down. He then notices a woman walking before him, and something about her strikes him as strange. He examines her to try and figure out what it is. She is young, and her clothes are untidy and need mending; and as she walks she reels unsteadily. They reach a bench. She collapses on it and closes her eyes. Raskolnikov looks at her closely and realizes that she is drunk; it is strange because she appears only 16 years old and quite pretty.

As he stands perplexed in front of her, he notices a gentleman a short ways away who is eyeing the girl and clearly wishes to approach her with certain intentions. The man is impatiently waiting for Raskolnikov to leave.

Suddenly Raskolnikov gets very angry and is possessed by the desire to insult the man. He does so (calling him "Svidrigailov," a name which suggested a sketchy character) and they get into a fight. A policeman breaks up the fight.

He is a kindly-looking man, and Raskolnikov seizes him and shows him the girl. He explains that she doesn't look like a prostitute, but more as if she has been made drunk and then raped. Indignantly he tells the policeman how the dandy evidently wishes to use this girl as well, and entreats his help in saving her from such a man.

The policeman agrees to help, and tries to get the girl to tell him where she lives. Raskolnikov gives him 20 kopecks to hire a coachman to take her home. The girl, however, doesn't answer satisfactorily, and after a while, gets up and totters off down the street. The dandy follows on the other side of the street, and the policeman takes off to prevent him having his way with her.

Suddenly Raskolnikov shouts at the policeman to forget it, what does it matter to him? The policeman is befuddled, but assumes Raskolnikov is mad or drunk, and ignores him.

Raskolnikov irritably asks himself why he bothered to get involved, losing 20 kopecks in the process. But he sits down on the bench and thinks compassionately about the poor girl's likely fate.

He abruptly wonders where he had been heading when he left his flat, and realizes that he had been automatically on his way to see Razumikhin, one of his only friends from university. Razumikhin, too, has had to leave university, but is attempting to straighten things out so he can continue.

## Chapter 5:

Raskolnikov continues to be distracted by his automatic going to Razumikhin, trying to figure out why he had been going there. Suddenly, he decides he will go to him the day after "that" (i.e. the unnamed crime). Just as suddenly, he demands of himself whether "that" will ever really happen, and he jumps up from the bench.

He is about to head home, but the thought repulses him. He walks on feverishly until he finds himself facing the Islandsa group of small islands in the Neva delta where wealthy people had summer homes. He takes pleasure in the freshness and cleanliness of those surroundings, but soon is pained and irritated by them. On he walks, numbly and mindlessly observing his environs, counting his money, calculating how much he had left at the Marmeladovs'. He enters a nearby cook-shop, where he drinks a glass of vodka and eats a piece of pie. The vodka makes him sleepy and he turns around intending to go home, but he only gets so far before leaving the road and collapsing into sleep on the grass.

He dreams a strange and disturbing dream, in which he is seven years old and walking with his father in the late afternoon of a feast day. He recalls every detail of the little town. He and his father are walking past the tavern toward the cemetery. Outside the tavern stands a very large cart to which a small, skinny mare is harnessed. A group of drunken peasants comes boisterously out of the tavern; one of them, a young beefy man called Mikolka, shouts that he will take everyone for a ride in his cart. His invitation is greeted with derision and laughter, the general observation resting on the age and unfitness of the nag. Mikolka, however, swears he will make her gallop, and brandishes his whip with relish at the idea. Several men and one woman get in; everyone both in and around the cart is laughing at the idea. Two other men take whips to help Mikolka "whip her up."

Predictably, the horse can barely move the cart. The crowd and passengers laugh, but Mikolka is angered and beats the horse savagely. The young Raskolnikov protests to his father in fear and sadness, but his father tells him, "Come along, don't look!" The child breaks away from his father and runs to the horse, which is struggling painfully. Some remonstrances come from the crowd, but Mikolka is impervious. The mare starts to kick. Two men from the crowd grab whips and begin to beat the horse from the sides; Mikolka shouts at them to beat her on the eyes, and they do. Everyone starts to sing. Raskolnikov is crying and shouting and wringing his hands, but no one stops the outrage. The mare starts to kick again, though she is practically dead. Mikolka, enraged, grabs a shaft from the cart and, shouting "It's my goods!", brings it down heavily on the horse. However, she is not killed, and she even tries to drag the cart forward under three more blows and endless whipping. Mikolka grabs an iron crowbar and beats the mare with it until she dies. There is some reproach from the crowd. Raskolnikov is in a frenzy, and embraces and kisses the poor beast, then flies at Mikolka in a rage. His father grabs him and takes him out of the crowd.

Raskolnikov awakens damp with sweat, and is profoundly thankful that it was only a dream. But he buries his head in his hands and asks himself whether he will really kill "her" with an axe and steal from herat last, the unnamed crime is named.

He draws himself up with the thought that he knows he would not be able to endure committing such a crimeso why has he been torturing himself for so long? This thought seems to clear his mind somewhat, and he feels relieved of a burden. He prays for guidance, saying, "I renounce this cursed . . . dream of mine!"

He feels calm, at peace, free as he gazes at the Neva.

He returns home via a long detour through the Haymarket (which he later regards as a strange twist of fate), and there hears Lizaveta Ivanovna, half-sister of the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna, talking with a tradesman and his wife. The couple convince Lizaveta to see them the next day between 6 and 7 pm to arrange some sort of deal.

Raskolnikov leaves, possessed by the thought that at exactly 7:00 the next evening, the pawnbroker will be at home alone. He feels that he no longer has freedom of mind or will, and that the course of events has been abruptly and irrevocably set by this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

## Chapter 6:

As Raskolnikov later discovers, the business the trade couple has with Lizaveta involves her acting as a middleman for a poor family forced to sell off their goods. Lizaveta is successful at this sort of thing, since she is very honest and always names a fair and final price.

Though the matter is an everyday one, Raskolnikov has become too superstitious to help seeing it as a very odd coincidence.

He recalls another "odd coincidence," which occurred just after the first time he had seen Alyona Ivanovna to pawn a ring Dunya had given him. Even that first encounter spawned an intense loathing in him, which stirred a strange thought in his head. He stopped for tea at a tavern, preoccupied by this idea.

Next to him sat a young officer and a student, who brought Raskolnikov out of his thoughts by mentioning Alyona Ivanovna. This coincidence startled Raskolnikov, but what followed surprised him even more as the student began describing the woman's life and character in great detail. The two men discussed Lizaveta as well, and Raskolnikov learned that Lizaveta was 35, Alyona's younger half-sister, and virtually enslaved to the pawnbroker. Awkward but somehow pleasant-looking and kind, Lizaveta was constantly pregnant.

The student clearly liked Lizaveta but added that he could kill and rob Alyona with not a shred of remorse. Raskolnikov started. The student asked the officer whether the thousands of lives that could benefit from Alyona Ivanovna's money would not make up for the "tiny little crime" of killing hera stingy, cruel old woman whom everyone hatesand taking her money to put it to use for the good of humankind. The officer responded by asking the student whether he himself would kill her. The student replied that he certainly wouldn't. The officer rejoined, "If you yourself don't dare, then there's no justice in it at all!"

At the time, Raskolnikov had been amazed and agitated that the student had expressed the exact thoughts that he himself had had. There seemed some sort of predestination in it.

Now he throws himself on the sofa and falls into a heavy sleep. He is awakened by Nastasya the next morning. She is indignant at how much he sleeps, especially as she comes back a few hours later and finds him lying there with his food untouched. She wonders if he is sick. After she leaves, he eats a little and has strange daydreams about being in an oasis drinking clear water and enjoying fresh air. . .

Suddenly the clock strikes, waking him up. He does not know the time, but he has spent the entire day and not done a single thing to prepare. He launches into feverish action. His first task is to sew a loop into his coat, to hold the axe so that he could walk with it completely concealed. He then takes his "pledge"a piece of wood bound to a strip of iron, created to appear like a silver cigarette case, and tied and wrapped up in a complicated manner that would slow the woman down.

Suddenly he hears someone shouting that it is long past six. Startled, he rushes to his door and then starts downstairs. His last task is to steal an axe from the kitchen.

In his long analysis prior to this day, he had begun with the question of why crimes should be so easily solved. His conclusion was that the criminal would experience a "failure of will and reason" which would ultimately lead him to make a mistake leading to his detection. Raskolnikov decided that in his case he would allow no such "darkening of reason," and had planned out every detail so that he should be in control of his will and reason throughout the crime; but somehow, even as he makes the final preparations, he cannot believe that he is really going to go through with it.

Unfortunately for him, Nastasya is in the kitchen hanging laundry, so there is no way for him to go in and steal the axe. Forced to keep walking, Raskolnikov is greatly upset at his missed opportunity, and stops at the gateway, uncertain as to his course. His eye falls on a gleam coming from the caretaker's closet. He enters the room, determines that no one is home, and pulls out the gleaming object, which is an axe lodged between a couple of logs under a bench. He slips out, and no one has noticed.

Encouraged, he strolls along as inconspicuously as possible, trying to move casually although a clock indicates it is already 7:10. Somehow he is occupied with completely irrelevant thoughts on his way.

He manages to slip into Alyona Ivanovna's house unnoticed, and climbs the stairs to the fourth floor, where she lives. Her neighbors have moved away and the stairwell is quite empty. "Shouldn't I go away?" pops into his head, but he does not bother to address his own mental question. He tries to calm down, but his heart insists on pounding harder and harder until finally he rings the bell.

There is no answer, but Raskolnikov knows she must be at home. He listens carefully and senses that someone is behind the door, hiding and listening. To dispel any suspicion, he makes a movement and murmurs something, and rings once more, calmly. The latch is lifted.

## Chapter 7:

The door is opened a crack and two eyes peer out at him mistrustfully. Flustered, Raskolnikov pushes his way past her into the apartment. She chases after him, demanding who he is and what he wants. He tells her she knows him already and offers her the "pledge." She stares at him without taking it until, somehow afraid of her glance, he bursts out with impatience. Finally she takes it and starts trying to unwrap it. Surreptitiously, he takes hold of the axe and, when she turns to him in vexation, hits her on the head with the butt-end. She falls, and he hits her twice more till she is dead.

Trying not to stain himself with her blood, he takes her keys and goes into the bedroom. Seized by a sudden uncertainty that she may not be dead, he rushes back. It is clear she is dead, but he notices something on a string around her neck, and takes ita purse with two crosses. He takes the purse and drops the crosses on the body, then returns to the bedroom.

After some agonizing failed attempts to use the keys, Raskolnikov remembers that the large key must be for some sort of trunk. He finds the chest under the bed, opens it, and rummages through the clothes he finds to discover that numerous gold objects have been hidden among the folds. Immediately, he starts stuffing his pockets with these.

Suddenly, he hears footsteps. He freezes. There is a soft cry of pain. After a moment, he grabs his axe and rushes out of the bedroom.

There stands Lizaveta. She sees him, and backs into a corner, never even screaming or making an effectual movement to defend herself. He rushes at her and strikes her on the head with the sharp edge, splitting her skull.

This unexpected second murder grips Raskolnikov with animal fear. He cannot think clearly, cannot see the situation as a whole. He notices a bucket of water in the kitchen, and goes to wash his hands and the axe. He tries to inspect his clothes as well, but he knows that he may be missing something obvious, and fears that he is losing his reason. Panicked, he thinks he must run away, and rushes to the entryway of the apartment.

There he finds that the outside door, between the entryway and the stairs, is open! He realizes that Lizaveta must have opened it on her way in. In terror, he runs to the door and hooks it. After a moment, he unhooks it again and listens in the stairway. When at last, things seem to subside, he steps outbut then hears new footsteps. Somehow he knows these are destined for the pawnbroker's apartment. He is frozen to the spot, feeling as though he is in a dream, until the footsteps reach the fourth flight, and at that point manages to slip into the apartment and quietly close and hook the door. He crouches behind the door, listening.

The visitor, who sounds to Raskolnikov as though he is rather portly, rings the bell a couple of times, then starts tugging at the door with all his might. Raskolnikov feels like he is about to faint. The visitor shouts through the door and rings again.

Another person joins the large gentleman, whom he addresses as Koch. Raskolnikov guesses from his voice that the newcomer is younger. The two men outside the door discuss why no one is answering, and conclude that it is strange that Alyona Ivanovna should be out. Just as Koch is ready to leave, he gives the door a final tug, and the younger fellow notices that the door must be hooked but not locked, since it gives when Koch pulls it. That means someone must be inside, otherwise the door couldn't be latched from inside and would have to be locked from outside.

Koch sees the young man's logic, and starts to tug again, but the young man stops him, knowing something is not right. He decides that he should run downstairs to fetch the caretaker, while Koch should stay there just in case.

The young man, a future public investigator, rushes downstairs. Koch stays for a while, his presence sending Raskolnikov into a delirium of fear. At last, suddenly, Koch impatiently runs downstairs.

Raskolnikov, still not quite thinking, opens the door and listens; and abruptly closes the door as tightly as possible and starts down the stairs. As he goes, he is scared by people shouting at one another, and then hears the investigative party, led by Koch and the young man, coming up the stairs. Raskolnikov decides to meet them; but on the second floor, an apartment which is being painted stands wide open, and he slips into it and hides until the party passes. Then he rushes downstairs and outside, encountering no one.

Though he knows that the investigators will be surprised at finding the door open and shocked at discovering the murders, and that they will not take long to surmise what had happened while they had left the apartment door unattended, he refuses to hurry or alter his course. Nearly collapsing, he somehow manages to get home, return the axe unnoticed, and goes to his room, where he lies oblivious, unable to rest on a single one of the thoughts swirling around his head.
